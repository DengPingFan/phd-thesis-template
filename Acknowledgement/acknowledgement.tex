I would have not finished this dissertation without the supports of many people. 

At first, I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Shin'ichi Satoh and Prof. Duy-Dinh Le since the beginning until the very end of my PhD. 

Second, I would like to send my sincere gratitude to other professors in my PhD committee including Prof. Akihiro Sugimoto, Prof. Amari Sato and Prof. Gene Cheung. Without your valuable comments, my PhD would have taken longer. 

I would like to thank all of my friends who have been encouraging me during my PhD. Especially to all my friends at National Institute of Informatics, Japan who has been my companies on the way obtaining my PhD.  

Last but not least, I want to thank my parents, my relatives and my love for your enduring support and love.
