This dissertation would have not finished without the support of many people.

I have been very fortunate to be supervised by Prof. Shin'ichi Satoh, who has a profound knowledge in my research area, who is always nice and provides whatever support for his students.

I am grateful to be co-supervised by Prof. Duy-Dinh Le, who always takes care of my research progress as well as other members in our group. I have been extremely lucky to be your student.     

I also want to send my sincere gratitude to other professors in my Ph.D committee including Prof. Akihiro Sugimoto, Prof. Imari Sato and Prof. Gene Cheung. Without your valuable comments, my PhD would have taken longer to complete. 

I would like to thank all of my friends who are always encouraging me to keep studying. Especially, I must thank my friends at National Institute of Informatics, Japan who have been my companies and/or my collaborators on the way pursuing my Ph.D.  

Finally, I want to thank my parents and my love for your enduring support and love.
